## [SNVformer: An Attention-based Deep Neural Network for GWAS Data](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.07.499217v2.full.pdf)

This paper was released in July 2022 as part of the *2022 ICML Workship on Computational Biology*

Authors: Kieran Elmes, Diana Benavides-Prado, Neset Ozkan Tan, Trung Bao Nguyen, Nicholas Sumpter, Megan Leask, Michael Witbrock, Alex Gavryushkin.

Why am I reading it: I want to see what existing methods are available for representation learning of GWAS data.
